To run the script

ns [VEGAS|SACK] [1|2|3]

It creates output_[VEGAS|SACK]_[1|2|3] depending on one of the six combinations for which it is run

The format of these output files is:

"Time for calculation: [expr $time] sec"
"Now: [expr $now]"
"Number of bytes received at sink1: [expr $diff1]"
"Number of bytes received at sink2: [expr $diff2]"
"Throughput at sink1: [expr $bw1] bps"
"Throughput at sink2: [expr $bw2] bps"	
"Ratio: [expr $ratio]"

It also displays at console: 

"Throughput at sink1: [expr $bw1] bps"
"Throughput at sink2: [expr $bw2] bps"	
"Ratio: [expr $ratio]"


It also creates two output files sink1.tr and sink2.tr

These files record time and bandwidth at sink1 and sink2 starting for t=100 to 400sec in intervals of 10 sec.
This file is then used as input for Xgraph to plot time vs. throughput for both sinks in a graph.
